## Game Objective

The objective of this revamped arcade game is to get to the other side of the street without colliding with the bugs. In order to play the game the user needs to use the arrows keys on their keyboard and simply try to dodge the bugs to make it to the other side. Be careful because if you happen to collide with one of the bugs the game will reset and take you back to your starting position.

ENJOY!!
